<h2>Prices</h2>

<p>Liftpass uses JSON and CSV file formats to store prices for application goods and IAP rewards. The structure of the price files can be broken into two kinds:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Simple files which namely specify a single price/reward for each good the application offers</li>
	<li>Complex files that use one or more progress metrics in order to derive the appropriate set of prices/rewards for a player</li>
</ol>

<p>Each format of pricing sets is called a pricing engine in Liftpass. Liftpass currently supports 4 pricing engines: JSON, CSV, MetricCSV and DTJSON.</p>

<p>When getting started with Liftpass it is recomended to have at least one set of simple price sets available.</p>

<h3>JSON</h3>

<p>For developers this is perhaps the easiest way to enter prices and rewards for goods offered in the application. The JSON file must be a dictionary with keys representing the name of the goods and the value must either be an integer or an array of 8 integers (or null) representing the 8 currencies Liftpass supports. </p>

{% highlight 'json' %}{
	"sword": 100,
	"knife": 50,
}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight 'json' %}{
	"sword": [100, 50, 0, null, null, null, null, null],
	"knife": [50, 0, 200, null, null, null, null, null]
}{% endhighlight %}


<h3>CSV</h3>

<p>Most product managers and game designers are very familiar with using Excel to manage and tweak prices and rewards of their game. Liftpass offers an easy way to get prices into the game by simply exporting the Excel sheet into CSV. The CSV file has no heading columns. The first column is the name of the virtual good or IAP. Each row must either have 9 columns (name of good and 8 virtual currency values) or two columns (name of good and single virtual currency value).

<pre><code>sword, 100
knife, 50
</code></pre>

<pre><code>sword, 100, 50, 0, null, null, null, null, null
knife, 50, 0, 200, null, null, null, null, null
</code></pre>

<h3>MetricCSV</h3>

<p>MetricCSV is an easy way to deliver different prices to different players based on a single progress metric. Generally speaking each column reprents a set of prices based on the value of a single progress metric. The first column is the name of the goods, the second column is the set of prices if the player does not fit into any of the later progress metrics, and the remaining columns are for each progress metric value you want to target unique prices to. The very top left value should be the name of the progress metric (ex. metricString1, metricString2, ...).</p>

<p>The first row of the csv can take the following shape:</p>

<pre><code>metricString4, Default, US, BR, DE</code></pre>

<p>This means that 4 set of prices will be defined. Assuming that metricString4 represents the country the player is in, this CSV will contain 4 sets of prices: United States, Brazil, Germany and a default set of prices for all other players.</p>

<p>After the first row, the row begins with the name of a virtual good or IAP followed by a single virtual currency price/reward for each of the pricing sets. Here is a complete example of MetricCSV file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>metricString4, Default, US, BR, DE
sword, 100, 200, 50, 75
knife, 50, 50, 100, 150
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">MetricCSV does not support more than a single currency pricing/rewards per good, per progress metric. Namely the price/reward entered represents the first currency the game has.</div>

<p>Liftpass also has the ability to lookup the user's location based on the IP address. The country code derived on the server can also be used for looking up prices. Instead of using metrics like metricString4 or metricNumber12, use country instead. </p>


<pre><code>country, Default, US, BR, DE
sword, 100, 200, 50, 75
knife, 50, 50, 100, 150
</code></pre>

<p>Just like in the previous example, the price returned to the user will be based on their location. Except that instead of looking at the player progress data sent by the player to derive a price, this time the country code found by the server is used.</p>


<h3>DTJSON</h3>

<p>When targeting players with more than a single metric, DTJSON (for Decision Tree JSON) is the prefered pricing engine. The decision tree has nodes with 4 keys:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>metric</code>: The index number of the progress metric used for deciding which child node to go to next. Values are between 0 (representing metricString1) and 31 (representing metricNumber24).</li>
	<li><code>method</code>: The method of comparing the metric. The value can be either:
		<ul>
			<li><code>lookup</code>: The metric value must be contained in the child node's key.</li>
			<li><code>range</code>: The metric value must be within the range of the child node's key.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>keys</code>: Every child node has a corresponding key. A key is an array containing either possible values for the metric (when the <code>method</code> is equal to <code>lookup</code>) or two values corresponding to the minimum and maximum (when the <code>method</code> is equal to <code>range</code>).</li>
	<li><code>values</code>: List of children. Children can either be further decision tree nodes or be a set of prices. This is determined by wether the node has the 4 primary described keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple example of DTJSON below has a height of 2 and provides 4 sets of prices depending on two different player metrics.</p>

{% highlight 'json' %}
{
	"metric": 12,
	"method": "range",
	"keys": [[0,10], [11, 20]],
	"values": [{
		"metric": 5,
		"method": "lookup",
		"keys": [["US", "BR"], ["JP", "IT"]],
		"values":[{"sword": 1000}, {"sword": 500}]
	},{
		"metric": 5,
		"method": "lookup",
		"keys": [["US", "BR"], ["JP", "IT"]],
		"values":[{"sword": 500}, {"sword": 1000}]
	}]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>For example if a user has progress metric 12 (which is a numeric metric) with the value of 16, and metric 5 (which is a string metric) with value of "BR", the price for "sword" will be 1000 for currency 1. However if progress mertric 12 is 7 and progress metric 5 is 'UK' then the user will receive no prices. </p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	DTJSON has very limited error checking. If there is an error the user will receive no prices and only those cahced on the device will be used. 
</div>

<h4>Wildcard values</h4>

<p>If a metric value does not match any of the keys, DTJSON will return to the user no prices. The safest way to ensure that the user always gets new sets of prices is to have at least one key contain the '*' (or wildcard token). If no key matches the current progress metric value, the node that has the key with the wildcard will be used. Below is the same example as above, however using wildcards.</p>

{% highlight 'json' %}
{
	"metric": 12,
	"method": "range",
	"keys": [[0,10], [11, 20]],
	"values": [{
		"metric": 5,
		"method": "lookup",
		"keys": [["US", "BR", "*"], ["JP", "IT"]],
		"values":[{"sword": 1000}, {"sword": 500}]
	},{
		"metric": 5,
		"method": "lookup",
		"keys": [["US", "BR"], ["JP", "IT", "*"]],
		"values":[{"sword": 500}, {"sword": 1000}]
	}]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now if progress mertric 12 is 7 and progress metric 5 is 'UK' then the user will see that the price for the sword is 1000.</p>

<p>The metric can also the country the user is in, derived by the server based on his/her IP address. When metric "country" is used, it must be also used with the "lookup" method.</p>

{% highlight 'json' %}
{
	'metric': 'country',
	'method': 'lookup',
	'keys': [['US', 'BR'], ['JP', 'IT'], ['*']],
	'values': [{'sword': 1000}, {'sword': 500}, {'sword': 100}]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If the user, based on the IP address, is in Japan, the price for the sword will be 500.</p>
