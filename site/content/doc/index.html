<h3>How Liftpass works</h3>

<p>Fundamentally Liftpass manages prices of virtual goods and the rewards for in-app purchases. In conjunction with the SDK, Liftpass enables developers to iterate on those prices and target specific users with customized prices based on their progress in the application.</p>

<p>At the moment the SDK requests a new set of prices the Liftpass server figures out based on the analytics recorded about the user which set of prices the user should receive.</p>
