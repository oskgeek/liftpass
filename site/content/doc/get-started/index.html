<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>You should be able to build Liftpass on most Linux-based systems.</p>

<h3>Get the build dependencies</h3>

<p>Liftpass is developed in Python 3.x. There are a number of modules required for running the server, however all are available through <code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code>. In a fresh Ubuntu installation run:</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
sudo apt-get install git python3-setuptools build-essential python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev python3-pip nodejs
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Get the source code</h3>

<p>Download or clone the Liftpass repository:

{% highlight 'bash' %}
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whiteshoemedia/gondola-core.git
# Download repository as a zip file
wget https://github.com/whiteshoemedia/gondola-core/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Install dependencies</h3>

<p>For most Linux-based systems <code>pip</code> can automatically install all required Python module dependencies.

{% highlight 'bash' %}
cd liftpass
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Configuring Liftpass</h3>

<p>Liftpass is configured via the <code>config.py</code> file. This file is generated by running the configure command. At this time default required directories will also be created. </p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python manage.py configure
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Database</h3>

<p>Once the <code>config.py</code> file has been generated you can build Liftpass's database. This will create all required tables that Liftpass uses.</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python manage.py content create
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	By default Liftpass is configured to run locally. As such, it uses local storage and SQLite for database which will not scale or manage with higher traffic loads. More information on configuring Liftpass for deployment can be found at <a href="/doc/server/">Liftpass Server</a> documentation page.
</div>


<h3>Starting the server</h3>

<p>You are now ready to manually start running ths server.</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python manage.py API start
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>To make sure everything has been installed and configured correctly it is encouraged that you test Liftpass.</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python manage.py test all
{% endhighlight %}

<p>All unit-tests should complete successfully and without errors. Because the tests will not cleanup after themselves it is encouraged that you re-create the Liftpass database: </p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python manage.py content flush
python manage.py content create
{% endhighlight %}
